# MS Access Dump Format

Through the COM interface it is possible to dump internal resources (e.g. forms, macros, queries, reports etc.) of a Microsoft Access application into separate files[[1]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/187506/how-do-you-use-version-control-with-access-development).
This allows to develop such an application with multiple developers simultaneously.
To ease the handling of such files this VSCode extension provides syntax highlighting for that dump format.
